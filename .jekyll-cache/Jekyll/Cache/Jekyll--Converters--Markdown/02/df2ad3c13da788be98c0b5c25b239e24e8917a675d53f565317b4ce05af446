I"H<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) hold great promise in beneficial, accurate, and effective predictive and real-time decision-making in a wide range of use cases. However, there are concerns regarding potential risks, harm, trust, and fairness issues arising from some AI algorithmsâ€™ opacity and potential unfairness because of their un-explainability and concern with objectivity.</p>

<p>AI has become an integral part of our daily lives, influencing decision-making processes across various domains such as finance, healthcare, employment, and criminal justice. While AI has the potential to revolutionize industries and improve efficiency, it also brings forth a critical concern: fairness. AI fairness refers to the ethical principle of ensuring that the outcomes produced by AI systems are unbiased, equitable, and do not perpetuate or amplify existing social, economic, or cultural biases.</p>

<p>AI fairness encompasses the principles and techniques that aim to minimize and mitigate biases and discrimination embedded within AI systems. Biases can emerge from various sources, including biased training data, algorithmic design, or the way the AI model is deployed. These biases can lead to unfair outcomes, exacerbating existing societal disparities and reinforcing discrimination against marginalized groups.</p>
